## [Thrashing in OS](scaler.com/topics/thrashing-in-os)
As we all know, to execute a program it has to be present in the main memory or RAM. We can easily download and store big programs in GBs like video games, in secondary memory devices (hard disks or SSDs) but ultimately they have to be moved to RAM when they are getting executed. There are multiple memory management techniques for managing data between secondary memory and primary memory. One of the most practically used techniques is paging. Memory management is necessary simply because RAM is smaller in size compared to secondary memory and therefore, cannot store any such programs completely that have size greater than the size of RAM.
Before jumping into thrashing, let us make ourselves a little comfortable with some terminologies. If you have a laptop with 16GB RAM and want to play a video game like Call of Duty that requires 113GB of space, will you be able to play it on your laptop? Yes, definitely. And what makes it possible? Yeah, we all know the answer â€“ we use the concept of Virtual Memory where instead of copying the entire program, only the active part of it needs to be present in the main memory for execution. That is, the part which is running at the current point of time was only copied to RAM. Once the current active part is done execution, it gets replaced by the next part. A simple example could be while playing a video game, the level or stage you select to play gets loaded in RAM for execution and not all the levels/stages.

## [What is Thrashing in OS](https://www.scaler.com/topics/thrashing-in-os/#what-is-thrashing-in-os-)?
In multiprogramming, there can be a scenario when the system spends most of its time shuttling pages between the main memory and the secondary memory due to frequent page faults. This behaviour is known as thrashing.
A process is said to be thrashing if the CPU spends more time in serving page faults than executing the pages. This leads to low CPU utilization and the Operating System in return tries to increase the degree of multiprogramming.
